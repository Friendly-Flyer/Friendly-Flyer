A mobile first app to help users get flights for their ideal price.
  
A collaborative application built by Will Kencel and Taylor Davis using some technologies that we're really excited about

##Tech Stack:
- React Native/Expo
- React Query Hooks
- Skyscanner API accessed through Rapid API
- Twilio API

##How it works

1. The user selects their starting airport, a place they want to visit and the price they'd like to pay for a ticket.

2. React Query Hooks persistently queries the skyscanner API for data on flights that match your criteria

3. When a flight to a specified destination drops below the designated price, a text message is sent to the user



**We hope that this application is something that can help both developers and users go on trips to their dream destinations for a price that doesn't break the bank.**
